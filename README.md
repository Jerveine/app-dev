### Favorite Scene
One of the standout scenes is the **"Red Circle Nightclub" fight**, where John systematically takes down dozens of enemies with a mix of precision gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. The neon-lit environment and pumping soundtrack make it unforgettable.

### Why I Love It
- **Keanu Reeves** delivers a perfect mix of vulnerability and badassery.
- The **fight choreography** is unparalleled, blending martial arts with gunplay (a.k.a. *gun-fu*).
- The movie creates a fascinating **underground assassin world** with rules and traditions, setting it apart from other action films.
